My name is Richard Silverton and I'm a thirty-something technology and running enthusiast in London, although I was fortunate enough to have been born and raised in [God's own country](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/03/yorkshire).

I'm at least ten years too late to be starting a blog, but I'm doing so anyway, partly in the hope that it becomes retro-fashionable at some juncture, a bit like vinyl or sailor tattoos.

If you read anything interesting, useful or particularly repellent on here, please do let me know.  Of course, I make no promises regarding the likelihood of any of that happening.
