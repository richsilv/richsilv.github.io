After years of expounding my ideas in places like pubs and football grounds, I've somewhat belatedly decided that a blog would be a better medium, not least because it's almost impossible to find a proxy for Javscript markdown in a beer garden.

I'm in my 30s, I come from Yorkshire, I live in London, and I enjoy hacking (mostly in Meteor) and running (when I'm not injured).  There's more about me on [here](http://richsilv.typify.io/), or you could [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/richsilvo) if you think you're capable of tolerating this sort of drivel in bite-sized pieces.
